# FORA 6 Connect for Home Assistant

An early-stage custom integration project for the **FORA 6 Connect** blood-testing meter, model **GD82**. The goal is to use Home Assistant's Bluetooth stack, including a local adapter or an ESPHome Bluetooth Proxy, to communicate with the meter. ESPHome will remain a generic proxy.

**Status:** Stages 0, 1, 2A–2G, 3, and 4 are complete for their authorized scopes. Stage 4's reusable Home Assistant Bluetooth transport passed user-run real-GD82 identity and bounded record regressions with the meter ON. Unresolved protocol semantics remain open. The development record action exposes no decoded health result. Production discovery, record synchronization, and measurement entities remain unimplemented; this project is not ready for health monitoring.

The documented BLE service and characteristic UUIDs are recorded in [the protocol evidence register](docs/PROTOCOL.md). They do not by themselves prove an observed device is a FORA 6 Connect.

## Project plan

[FORA6_MASTER_ROADMAP.md](FORA6_MASTER_ROADMAP.md) is the authoritative stage plan. The [Stage 4 transport record](docs/STAGE4_BLUETOOTH_TRANSPORT.md) describes the reusable session, tests, and physical regression closure. **Exact next gate:** separately authorize Stage 5 after reviewing its measurement/entity scope and unresolved semantics relevant to exposure. [CURRENT_STATUS.md](CURRENT_STATUS.md) and [CODEX_HANDOVER.md](CODEX_HANDOVER.md) record the current state.

## Development

See [docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for local checks. Future discovery work should follow [docs/CAPTURE_GUIDE.md](docs/CAPTURE_GUIDE.md) and keep private health data out of the public repository.

The repository follows the Home Assistant custom integration layout and includes HACS metadata. HACS support and production device operation are later-stage goals; the Stage 1B and Stage 1C actions are installed manually for controlled development testing only.
